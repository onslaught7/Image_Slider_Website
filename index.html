                        Marshall D. Teach, known as "Blackbeard," is the captain of the Blackbeard Pirates and one of the Four Emperors. He is the only person in history to wield the powers of two Devil Fruits, having stolen the Yami Yami no Mi and Whitebeardâ€™s quake-generating power. Formerly a Whitebeard Pirates member, he betrayed them, capturing Portgas D. Ace and killing Whitebeard. His actions earned him a place among the Seven Warlords and later as an Emperor. Teach is a central antagonist, with his ambitions leading to major conflicts throughout the series, including the deaths of Ace and Whitebeard.

                        Buggy the Star Clown, captain of the Buggy Pirates and former Roger Pirates apprentice, was one of Luffy's earliest foes. His involvement in the Summit War of Marineford unintentionally elevated his reputation, leading him to become one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and later founding Buggy's Delivery. After the Warlord system's abolition, he co-founded the Cross Guild with Mihawk and Crocodile, becoming its public leader and one of the Four Emperors. Buggy is a recurring character in the series, playing both antagonistic and supporting roles across various arcs.

                        Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, aims to become the Pirate King by finding Gol D. Roger's legendary treasure. Son of Revolutionary leader Dragon and grandson of Marine hero Garp, Luffy's childhood was shaped by Shanks, who inspired him to pursue piracy. Luffy's body became rubber after accidentally eating the Gomu Gomu no Mi. He has defeated powerful foes, including Emperors and Warlords, and gained widespread infamy. Now a member of the Four Emperors, Luffy is recognized as a central figure of the Worst Generation with a bounty of Beli 3,000,000,000.

                        "Red-Haired" Shanks is the chief of the Red Hair Pirates and one of the Four Emperors ruling the New World. Formerly an apprentice on Gol D. Roger's ship, he inspired Monkey D. Luffy to become a pirate, gifting him Roger's straw hat and accidentally giving him the Gomu Gomu no Mi. Shanks sacrificed his left arm to save Luffy, and his influence is felt throughout the series as Luffy's reputation grows.
